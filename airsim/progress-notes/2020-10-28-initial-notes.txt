# Initial notes on AirSim

## Cube flight pattern

Took me about 2 hours to get this working, maybe?
Most of the time was spent figuring out idiosyncracies of the platform
(negative Z is up, camera settings) and just messing up things like
calling .join() after async methods or making sure to exit/clean up
properly at the end of the simulation.

For the first iteration I just used `moveOnPathAsync`, which is obviously
a very high-level function call.
But there are lower-level calls available, too, particularly
moveByRollPitchYawrateThrottleAsync which I suspect may match the Crazyflie
API capabilities pretty well.

### Settings

I added these settings to the settings.json file in "My Documents/AirSim":

```
{
  ...,
  "SimMode": "Multirotor",
  "ViewMode": "Manual"
}
```

Did this to get a fixed camera so I could see the flight pattern more clearly.
It was a bit hard to tell what was going on with the camera following
the drone around all the time.
